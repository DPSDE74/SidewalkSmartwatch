# SidewalkSmartwatch
Sidewalk is a smartphone and smartwatch wayfinding application (for everyone) especially designed for Visually Impaired People (VIPs).  The video demonstrates the concept, its main functionalities and the experience while the user prepares a route at the ease of their home and starts its navigation.   [PREPARE A ROUTE] The Sidewalks smartphone app helps the user prepare and practice a walking route. It offers more than Google Maps do, as it implements OpenStreetMaps API, local municipal data, beacons and personal points of interest of the user. As a result it offers 4 routes: The Fastest, the Easiest to remember, the Safest or the Personalized.   [NAVIGATE THE ROUTE] The Sidewalk smartwatch app is in charge of taking the user to their destination. It requires compass (magnetometer) sensor to function properly. Audio is used for announcing instructions and preparing the user for their next decision or dangers of the surroundings (from Beacons, GPS). Vibrations deliver tactile feedback to re-confirm that the user is on track heading correctly. Visuals are used as a backup and they are the ideal feedback for those with more than 30% of visual acuity.  Project by: Edwin D'Mello, Pinar Kesenci, Roselinde Loeffen, Konstantinos Partheniadis.
